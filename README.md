The gaming industry has experienced an explosion of growth in the past decade, spawning thousands upon thousands of games in the market. The average consumer does not have enough time or energy to go through and look at all of these titles to determine what they would want to play or invest themselves into. Due to these constraints, most video games sit unnoticed and people stick to the large titles which benefit from large expensive publicity campaigns. One of our goals is to make information about less publicized games just as easy to look-up, thereby making it easier for users to find hidden gems that they might otherwise have never noticed.

This database functions similarly to and is based upon another existing service, the Internet Movie Database (IMDb). Using our web application, people will be able to search up specific video games and get more information about it, or just browse through a list of games to discover new ones. One difference however is that the database is mostly communally curated, with registered users being given the privilege to contribute information about new games they have discovered so that other people can find them.

This database and its application will display to the end user the general information for a video game title in an easy to read format with links to external sources and provide some statistics about the game such as ratings, publisher, price etc. The audience ranges from a the average video game purchaser to employees of publishers who want to manage their portfolios based or quickly survey their competitors.
